## 1 IMRaD skeleton

Order in manuscript: Title → Abstract → Keywords → Introduction → Methods → Results → Discussion →
(Conclusion) → References → Tables/Figures → Supplementary → Declarations. (Cover letter is separate;
see `submission-materials.md`.)

Each section answers one question:
- Introduction — **why** was the study done?
- Methods — **how** was it done?
- Results — **what** was found?
- Discussion — **what do the findings mean?**
- Conclusion — **what is the contribution and implication?**

**Writing order**: Results + Methods first, then Introduction + Discussion, then Abstract + Title + cover letter.

**Build a result–interpretation–contribution map before Discussion.** For each of 3–5 key results, fix:
(a) one interpretation/mechanism point, (b) one literature comparison point, (c) one significance point.
The Discussion must use this map. Cross-check coherence: the Introduction's gap must be answered by
Methods+Results, and the Discussion must return to the Introduction's gap.

## 2 Title

Include: study population/object · core exposure/intervention/method · core outcome · design/data source
(when informative). Common patterns:
- `Association between X and Y among Z: a cohort study`
- `Effects of X on Y: evidence from [data source]`
- `X and risk of Y: a population-based study`
- `Interactive effects of X and Y on Z`

Title page items (per journal): Full title · Running title · Authors · Affiliations · Corresponding
author · Author contributions · Word count · No. of tables/figures · Funding · Conflicts of interest ·
Ethics approval · Data availability · Acknowledgements. Missing author info → `[NEED CONFIRMATION]`.

Self-check: not too long; no unnecessary abbreviations; accurately reflects design; no causal over-claim;
matches journal capitalization/word/running-title rules.

---

## 3 Abstract

**Write last.** Structured (Background/Objective/Methods/Results/Conclusions) or unstructured per journal;
unstructured must still imply all five. Pull 1 background + 1 objective sentence from Introduction; design/
population/data/model from Methods; the 2–4 most important results; 1 interpretation/significance sentence.
Compress strictly to the journal word limit.

Self-check: contains explicit objective; methods specific enough; results carry key numbers (with CI/P);
conclusion consistent with results; obeys word limit and structure; keywords cover exposure, outcome,
design, and discipline.

## 4 Introduction — CRGP

Four moves, general → specific, every sentence serving the final aim:

1. **Context** — real-world/theoretical importance of the problem; why it matters now; add epidemiologic/
   policy/mechanistic background as needed.
2. **Review** — what prior studies found and showed; move from broad to closest-to-this-study. Synthesize,
   do not list paper-by-paper.
3. **Gap** — what is specifically missing and why this study is needed. The gap must directly lead to the aim.
4. **Purpose** — exactly what this study addresses; directly answers the gap.

**Gap must be specific**, not "few studies." Name the gap type: population / exposure / outcome / method
(non-linearity, lag, interaction, causal inference) / mechanism / practice (policy or clinical decision).

Self-check: funnels general→specific; every paragraph serves the aim; gap is specific not vague; purpose
maps 1-to-1 to the gap; does not over-report results; `[ref]` placeholders mark needed citations.

---

## 5 Literature review (synthesis)

Not a pile of references — organize, evaluate, and lead to the gap. Build a literature matrix first
(topic/mechanism/variable · population/data · method · findings · strengths · limitations · relation to
this study). Each paragraph: topic sentence → evidence synthesis → critical evaluation → gap/transition.

Three evaluation moves: positive (affirm contribution), negative (point out limitation), neutral (inference
or unresolved question). Only turn into a **specific gap** the limitations this study actually addresses;
general limitations of the field are not the gap.

Self-check: avoids paper-by-paper narration; groups similar studies; evaluates rather than only describes;
states why this study is necessary; ends with a bridge to the Aim.

---

## 6 Aims / Significance / Scope

**Aim** — lead with *what*, then *how*. Prefer `This study aimed to examine the association between X and Y
using Z data.` Avoid putting the method first (`Using a large dataset, this study aimed…`) unless the method
is the paper's contribution. Separate primary and secondary objectives.

**Significance** — a *predictive* contribution, stated cautiously (may/could). Goes at the end of the
Introduction or in Discussion/Conclusion. Do not state unproven results as fact.

**Scope** — study boundaries: what is included, what is excluded, why, and whether it limits interpretation.
Keep scope distinct from limitation (scope = deliberate boundary; limitation = shortcoming).

Self-check: aim specific to variable/object/outcome/method; significance uses hedging; scope states
boundaries clearly and is distinguished from limitations.

## 7 Methods (reproducible)

Structure: Study design and setting → Data source/participants/samples → Exposure/intervention/predictors →
Outcome definition → Covariates → Statistical analysis / experimental procedure → Sensitivity/subgroup
analyses → Ethical approval → Software.

Principles: follow the actual workflow; past tense for completed actions; define variables precisely;
statistical methods must map to the research question; do **not** interpret results here; report the
relevant reporting guideline (STROBE / CONSORT / PRISMA …).

**State what was done, not why/how it was decided** (the most common failure). Methods is not an analysis
diary or a justification of choices. Cut these four to a half-clause or delete: (1) motivation/justification
("to avoid collinearity…", "because the distribution was skewed…", "given that…"); (2) exclusion reasoning
("variable X was not included because it was unrelated…" → just state how X was handled); (3) pre-analysis
process / data-quality checks / diagnostics narration ("before analysis we checked completeness/missingness",
"we ran VIF/Shapiro/Cook…") — keep a diagnostic only when it determines which estimate is reported (e.g.
"because heteroscedasticity was detected, CIs are bootstrap-based"); (4) textbook definitions of a method
("MCA is a dimension-reduction technique that projects categories into a low-dimensional space…") → "we
applied MCA to the 12 categorical variables and retained the first three dimensions (44.0% of inertia)."
Signal that you drifted: "because / in order to / given / since / is a method that / before analysis we
checked." Build a composite the right way: "items A, B, C were summed into an accessibility score (0–6,
Cronbach α=0.75)" — not why it was not dichotomized, not why X was excluded, not what was checked first.

Self-check: design stated first; inclusion/exclusion clear; exposure & outcome definitions reproducible;
models map to the aim; software, version, significance level stated; reporting guideline followed; no
engineering noise (random seed, render engine, package build).

## 8 Results — LOC–KD–COM

1. **LOC** (locate) — point the reader to the table/figure.
2. **KD** (key data) — surface only the important numbers, not every cell.
3. **COM** (comment) — brief necessary interpretation/comparison, without drifting into Discussion.

Report only: highest/lowest values · overall trend · key comparisons · outliers · results tied to the
hypothesis · results supporting the main conclusion. One subsection per research question. Every table/
figure must be cited in text; key tables/figures must be embedded in text (not "see Table N" with no data).

Forbidden in Results: rewriting whole tables into prose; heavy literature citation; deep mechanism;
repeating Methods; reporting results unrelated to the aim.

Self-check: each subsection maps to a research question; every table/figure cited; key data highlighted not
exhaustively listed; no Discussion content; numbers/%/CI/P exactly match the tables and source.

---

## 9 Discussion (7-part)

1. **Principal findings** — open by summarizing 2–4 main findings; do not repeat all numbers.
2. **Comparison with previous studies** — state consistent or inconsistent, and explain why (population,
   exposure assessment, model specification…). Not just "consistent."
3. **Interpretation / mechanisms** — cautious, not asserted as fact.
4. **Strengths** — concrete (large sample, prospective design, high-quality data, repeated measures, robust
   sensitivity analyses, novel exposure/outcome/interaction, policy/clinical relevance), no empty praise.
5. **Limitations** — each = what the limitation is + why it exists + its effect on interpretation / how to
   handle it.
6. **Implications** — proportionate to the strength of evidence; no over-claim.
7. **Conclusion** — short close.

Self-check: returns to the Introduction's gap; explains each main finding; compares specifically with prior
work; avoids causal over-inference; limitations real/specific/explained; ending concise.

---

## 10 Conclusion (if a separate section)

Short, contribution-oriented, no over-claim. Elements available: restate aim (RE-AIM), summarize key results
(RE-RES), compare (CP), explain (EXP), generalize (GEN), significance (SIG), limitation (LIM),
recommendation (REC). A short paper usually needs one paragraph: what was found → what it suggests → what
future work is needed.

Forbidden: new results; large new literature; causal over-claim; repeating the abstract; data-unrelated
policy claims.

## 11 Per-section self-check (consolidated)

Run before marking any section complete:

| Section | Must pass |
|---------|-----------|
| Title | reflects design; no over-claim; meets journal title rules |
| Abstract | explicit objective; key numbers w/ CI/P; conclusion = results; within word limit |
| Introduction | general→specific; specific gap; purpose maps to gap; no result leak |
| Methods | reproducible; models map to aim; software/version/α stated; guideline followed |
| Results | per-question subsections; tables/figures cited & embedded; numbers match source; no interpretation |
| Discussion | returns to gap; each finding explained; specific comparison; limitations w/ 3 elements |
| Conclusion | no new content; no over-claim; proportionate |

Cross-section coherence (whole-draft): sample size consistent everywhere; same number in Abstract = Results
= Discussion = tables = source; Introduction gap answered by Results; Discussion returns to Introduction;
tense usage per `english-phrasebank.md`.
